## Some of my . files

To use this:

* clone this where you'd like (I use ~/dotfiles)
* make necessary edits
* make sure that you have [GNU stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)
* run `./install.sh`

## Notes

* My Emacs configuration could be greatly improved. I'd appreciate PRs.
* Some of the paths used in my configurations files are set for my system, you
  may have to update them for yours.
